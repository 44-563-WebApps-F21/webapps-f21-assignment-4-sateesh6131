        <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2> 

       <h4> _The Library in Lord Goringâ€™s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.

        LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]

        LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.

        LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.

        LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.

        LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
