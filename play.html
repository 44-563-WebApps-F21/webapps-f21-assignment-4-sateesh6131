       <h4> _The Library in Lord Goringâ€™s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.
